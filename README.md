# Severn Bronies 2016
**We're slowly building the new Severn Bronies website here!** Watch along and learn how to code stuff! [Raise bugs or request a feature!](https://github.com/severnbronies/severnbronies-website/issues) Find weaknesses to exploit and tell us how to fix them! The choice is yours! 

This repository contains a theme that works on top of an average WordPress installation, which when combined with a bunch of plugins and some pretty schwifty coding is able to ingest a bunch of custom post types and fields and spit out a bunch of neat looking stuff. Check out [the project wiki](https://github.com/severnbronies/severnbronies-2016/wiki) for information and instructions on this repo and the Severn Bronies website project.

This code and documentation is provided as-is without support. This code is provided as part of our continuing dedication to transparency in just about everything we do. Party on.
