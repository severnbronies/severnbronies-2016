title: Severn Bronies Pattern Library
---

This is a pattern library for the Severn Bronies website. Patterns are kind of like the pieces of a jigsaw puzzle, taken apart so you can inspect them individually, before being assembled to make a full website. 

If you know of any issues with the site, please raise them in our [GitHub issues](https://github.com/severnbronies/severnbronies-2016/issues) or, if you lack a GitHub account, [get in touch](http://severnbronies.co.uk/about/contact) some other way.
