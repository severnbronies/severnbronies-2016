    <p>Once again, congratulations to Hasbro for scheduling the FiM holiday special to the middle of summer. Nice that you&#8217;re thinking of the Australian fans like that.</p>
    <p>But first:</p>
    <h2>Got a neat idea?</h2>

    <p>The Great Brony Bake-Off. Whose Line is it Everypony&#8230; karaoke. These are just some of the weird and wonderful things that have graced out meet schedules over the last four years of meets. </p>
    <p>Unfortunately over time we&#8217;ve variously phased them out due to logistical issues, waning interest, or just being too expensive to do regularly and they&#8217;ve not been replaced with anything new. This kinda sucks, and while we want to continue doing interesting and unique things in the meet-space it&#8217;s tough to come up with fresh ideas within these constraints. </p>
    <p>As such, we&#8217;re opening up the floor. If you have a fresh, fun, interesting (and cheap) idea that you think we could do, drop an email to <a href="mailto:kim@severnbronies.co.uk">kim@severnbronies.co.uk</a> and we&#8217;ll consider it for inclusion in the future! </p>
    <p>With that out the way, here&#8217;s our meet. </p>

    <h2>Meet plan</h2>
    <p>We don&#8217;t always know what we&#8217;re doing, but when we do, we do. </p>
    <h3>11:00am–11:30am Starbucks!</h3>
    <p>Apparently cold brew is a thing now. It&#8217;s like hot coffee, but cold? I dunno, I don&#8217;t get it. </p>
    <h3>11:30am–1:30pm The Knight&#8217;s Templar</h3>
    <p>It&#8217;s Wetherspoons. What do you expect?</p>
    <h3>1:30pm–5:30pm Hydra Books</h3>
    <p>Hail Hydra.</p>
    <h4>Episode viewing: <em>A Hearth&#8217;s Warming Tail</em></h4>
    <p>Happy (not) Christmas ponyfolks! Spoiler: It&#8217;s another episode with Starlight Glimmer in it! </p>
    <h4>The People&#8217;s Ponydrome</h4>
    <p>In the past we&#8217;ve dictated what you should watch and listen to like illiberal, bourgeoisie pigs. Well no more! Using state-of-the-art computing technology, we have created a system where <em>you</em>, the common proletariat worker, can determine what you want to see (and by extension everybody else). </p>
    <p>DISCLAIMER: This system is experimental. It might not work, and heck, giving people unmoderated reign over a public broadcasting service is probably a really bad idea&#8230; We&#8217;ll see how it works out. </p>
    <h4>Every day we&#8217;re <del>rafflin&#8217;</del> auctionin&#8217;</h4>
    <p>The meets have been running for nearly four years (did we mention it&#8217;s been nearly four years?) and in that time we&#8217;ve built up a lot of what can only be called &#8220;guff&#8221;. Uncollected competition prizes, unclaimed lost property and leftover merch makes up a significant quantity of things clogging up Kim&#8217;s flat. Let&#8217;s get rid of it! </p>
    <p><del>Half of</del> ALL proceeds will go to our selected charity for this event—<a href="http://www.jessiemay.org.uk/">the Jessie May Trust</a>.</p>

    <h4>Games Bronies Play</h4>
    <p>As per usual there&#8217;ll be a bunch of people playing tabletop board games, card games, et al. Please don&#8217;t hesitate to join in! They&#8217;re actually quite fun you know!</p>
    <h3>5:30pm–6:30pm Forbidden Planet</h3>
    <p>Although their stock of pony stuff is pretty dry at the moment (has Hasbro even released anything new of note, lately?) they&#8217;re still the best place for all your geeky goodies!</p>
    <h3>6:30pm–??? idk subway or w/e</h3>
    <p>chill</p>
